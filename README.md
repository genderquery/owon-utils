A set of programs to use with OWON Oscilloscopes.

This program downloads data from the oscilloscope via USB. Depending on how
the device is configured, at binary waveform file or at bitmap screen capture
will be downloaded.

This program reads the file downloaded by `owondump` and writes the data in a
more useful format. Currently, it only supports writing delimited text files 
that can be used by gnuplot or a spreadsheet, for example.
